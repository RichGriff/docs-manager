description: These are custom records of data that we can retreive from the cms.

Collections are a key part of the Headless CMS (Strapi), they hold all the data that we need to be sent to the website. 
Some collections are essential to the structure of the website, these are:

- Pages
- Posts

Others are more focused on content for certain parts of the business.

#### How does this work?

1. From the website we make a request to the Strapi site. 
2. For example we want to grab all pages, we would use the following url:
`https://poblwebsite-cms-staging.azurewebsites.net/api/pages`
3. This will return json data for us to render the page. For example:

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "attributes": {
                "title": "About",
                "description": null,
                "slug": "about",
                "full_slug": "about",
                "createdAt": "2023-07-02T16:33:51.441Z",
                "updatedAt": "2023-10-27T11:19:36.888Z",
                "locale": "en",
                "keywords": null,
                "display_title": "about"
            }
        },
        {
            "id": 3,
            "attributes": {
                "title": "Careers",
                "description": null,
                "slug": "careers",
                "full_slug": "careers",
                "createdAt": "2023-07-02T16:39:07.031Z",
                "updatedAt": "2023-11-03T10:29:13.257Z",
                "locale": "en",
                "keywords": null,
                "display_title": "Careers"
            }
        },
    ]
}
```

The above is just a small example of the data, we in fact return a lot more including the content of the page.
