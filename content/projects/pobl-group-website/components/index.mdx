title: Components
description: These make up the page content and allow for a page builder style.

In order to make the website versatile and allow for a better user experience, we decided to go with a website page builder
approach. Using `Strapi` allows us to do this by using `Dyanmics Zones`.

#### How does this work?

Dynamics zones allow us to essentially pick and choose what elements we want. For example we add a Dynamic Zone to the Page content type.
We then set what other elements / components we want to be available to this section. In the Page editor the user 
can then select which of these components they want to add. 

#### What if a component is missing?

If you find a component is not available, this is most likely that we have not enabled if for this collection type. 
To get it added you can put in for a support ticket and the developers will get this added.
