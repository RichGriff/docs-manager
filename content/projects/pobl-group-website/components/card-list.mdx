#### Fields:
- Title - this is title for section and is shown before the cards
- Description - is a short description of the section that will appear under the title. If left blank nothing is shown.
- Type - this is what collection you want to show:
    - Student Rooms
    - Developments
    - Trust Grants
    - Trust Campaigns

#### Website View

As mentioned earlier this component will be displayed differently depending on what Type has been selected. The reason for this is because they all have different needs for those part of the business. In order to add additional collections to this option, a change request will need to be put in - as it involves development time.

Trust & Grants
